    Hi! I am Tarun Vasvani. <br>
    I am a commerce student shifting to computer science! 
    I am excited for this adventurous path.<br>

    I have created some CLI apps , I will schowcase them here ! 
    Stay Tunned !!!<br>

    I like to watch suspenseful-thriller , cult movies. What I like is the psychology behind the whole story and the individual story of its character, which play with your mind.
    One of my favourite series of such genre is Peaky Blinders, in this series current storm is because of the past incidents which shaped the psychology of its characters. That is what makes them, the watchers want to know what happend in their past which changed them.!
